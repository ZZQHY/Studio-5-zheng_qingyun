## About
My name is Zheng Qingyun, and I come from the industrial design major. I developed a strong interest in Arduino and related open-source hardware development since my freshman year's open-source programming course and actively applied it in subsequent design practices.

In this course, I hope to learn the basic knowledge of PCB board design and development, and gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between design and technology. In addition, I have a strong interest in the topic of nature and hope to learn design from a non-human-centered perspective in this studio.
